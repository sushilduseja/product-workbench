# Visual Assets

## Portfolio Context

Screenshots and diagrams in this repository demonstrate:
- Product documentation skills
- Technical architecture thinking  
- User experience design capability
- Metrics-driven decision frameworks

These are working prototypes and simulations, not production deployments. They validate technical implementation skills and product thinking applicable to real-world challenges.

## Organization

## Guidelines

**File Naming**
- Use descriptive, kebab-case names
- Include context in filename (e.g., `kyc-flow-optimization.png`)

**Formats**
- PNG for static images (diagrams, screenshots)
- GIF for short animations (under 2MB)
- Use external hosting (S3, CDN) for video files

**Dimensions**
- Desktop screenshots: 1280px - 1920px width
- Mobile screenshots: 375px - 414px width
- Maintain aspect ratios

**Optimization**
- Compress PNGs (aim for <500KB per image)
- Optimize GIFs with tools like Gifsicle
- Always provide descriptive alt text

## Usage

Reference visuals in project documentation:
```markdown
![Alt text](../visuals/project-name/screenshot.png)
