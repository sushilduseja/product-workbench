# Visuals

Place all visual assets here. Prefer external hosting (S3, CDN) for large files and keep small preview GIFs in this folder.

Suggested filenames (used in READMEs):
- `skills-radar.png`
- `dashboard.gif`
- `simulator.mp4`
- `tracker-chart.png`
- `analyzer.gif`
- `roadmap.png`
- `journey.gif`
- `case-deck.pdf`

Note: This repo currently contains placeholders; add real assets to match links in `README.md` and project READMEs.
