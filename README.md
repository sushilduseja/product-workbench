## Approach

Every project follows the same framework:

1. **Quantified Problem** - What business pain exists and how much does it cost?
2. **Solution Design** - What approach addresses root causes?
3. **Measurable Impact** - What improved and by how much?
4. **Key Learnings** - What worked, what didn't, what's next?
