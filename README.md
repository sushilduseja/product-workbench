# Product Workbench
**Product management frameworks validated through working prototypes**

## Featured Capability Demonstration
### Customer Journey Mapper
**Framework for diagnosing conversion friction through visual journey analysis**
**Simulated Outcome:** 53% drop-off reduction pathway · $1.2M recovery calculation · 8x identification acceleration model

*Metrics represent analytical frameworks applied to realistic fintech scenarios, not production deployments.*

## Approach

Every project follows the same framework:

1. **Quantified Problem** - What business pain exists and how much does it cost?
2. **Solution Design** - What approach addresses root causes?
3. **Measurable Impact** - What improved and by how much?
4. **Key Learnings** - What worked, what didn't, what's next?

*This portfolio demonstrates product management capabilities through working prototypes and analytical frameworks. Technical implementations are real; business scenarios model documented industry patterns. Metrics show calculation methodology, not production deployments. Evaluate for: problem diagnosis, solution design, technical execution, and communication clarity.*
