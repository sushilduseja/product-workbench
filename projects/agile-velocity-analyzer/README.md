# Agile Velocity Analyzer

**Sprint and process metrics visualization to improve flow**

## Problem
Lack of objective, visual metrics to drive process improvements. Teams couldn't identify bottlenecks in delivery pipeline.

## Solution
Dashboards and trend analysis for cycle time, throughput, and blockers.

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- Sprint velocity and predictability
- Cycle time by work item type
- Blocker frequency and resolution time
- Deployment frequency

## Impact
- **25% reduction** in deployment time
- Improved deployment frequency
- Data-driven retrospectives

## Key Learnings
- Visualizing trends drives better retrospective conversations
- Focus on flow metrics, not just velocity
- Team buy-in requires showing value quickly
