# Project template

Use this template to create a project folder under `/projects/<slug>`.

- `README.md` — one-liner, problem, solution, tech stack, results, links to demo
- `case-study.md` — detailed mini-case (problem, approach, metrics, lessons)
- `demo.md` — short guide to run or view the demo (links to visuals)
- `visuals/` — project-specific assets (optional)

Example structure:

projects/
  my-project-slug/
    README.md
    case-study.md
    demo.md
    visuals/
