# Algorithmic Trading Simulator — Case Study

## Problem
High risk and long validation cycles for new algos.

## Solution
A reproducible simulator with recorded market sessions and replay for deterministic testing.

## Impact
- Enabled safe validation of strategies, reducing live test failures by X% (update with measured metric)

## Notes
- Include example strategy and result CSVs in `visuals/` when available.

## Capability Validation Approach

**This demonstrates product management through working code + realistic scenarios:**

| Element | Validation Method |
|---------|------------------|
| Technical Skills | Deployed prototypes with measurable performance |
| Product Frameworks | Applied to documented industry patterns |
| Impact Modeling | Calculated using standard fintech economics |
| Documentation | Professional artifacts showing clear thinking |

**Evaluate this work for:** Problem diagnosis clarity · Solution design rigor · Metrics-based thinking · Execution capability

**Not production claims.** These are skill demonstrations using realistic parameters informed by capital markets experience.
