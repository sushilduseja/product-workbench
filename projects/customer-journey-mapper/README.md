## The Problem We Solve

### Current State: The Journey Intelligence Gap
- **47% of user drop-offs** happen in invisible friction zones
- **Average 2.3 weeks** to identify and validate journey problems  
- **$2.3M annual revenue loss** from undetected conversion leaks
- **Cross-functional misalignment** on user experience priorities

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Data Fragmentation:** Insights scattered across 8+ tools
2. **Visual Blindness:** No unified view of user flow
3. **Slow Validation:** Manual analysis takes weeks
4. **Stakeholder Disconnect:** Different teams see different problems

**Customer Journey Mapper** transforms this chaos into a single, breathing canvas where problems light up like city lights at dusk.

## ðŸŽ¬ Experience Walkthrough

**Scene 1: The Awakening**  
Sarah, a product manager at a growing fintech, opens Journey Mapper. Her screen transforms from blank white to a subtle gridâ€”like graph paper waiting for a masterpiece.

**Scene 2: The Construction**  
She grabs "Account Creation" from the component dock, drops it center-stage. Then "KYC Verification," then "First Deposit." As she connects them, a gentle blue line flows between stagesâ€”like a river finding its path.

![Building the Flow](../visuals/customer-journey-mapper/screenshots/features-section.png)

**Scene 3: The Revelation**  
Suddenly, KYC Verification *glows orange*. The platform detected a 47% drop-off here. Sarah hoversâ€”a sidebar slides out showing 89 user comments: "Too many documents!" "Confusing interface!" The problem that was invisible is now impossible to ignore.

![The Moment of Truth](../visuals/customer-journey-mapper/screenshots/impact-section.png)

**Scene 4: The Experiment**  
Sarah clicks "Create Variant" and simplifies the KYC flow. Two paths now display side-by-side. She launches the test. Within hours, green numbers rise on Variant Bâ€”drop-off plummets to 22%.

**Scene 5: The Share**  
One click exports a presentation-ready journey map with embedded metrics. Sarah's CEO sees it and says: "Finally, I understand what our users experience."
