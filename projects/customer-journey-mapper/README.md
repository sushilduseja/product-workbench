## The Problem We Solved

A Series A fintech startup was losing $2.3M annually—47% of users abandoned their KYC verification flow. But the real problem wasn't technical:

**The team couldn't see what users were experiencing.**

Data lived in 8+ disconnected tools:
- Product team: Analytics dashboards
- Support team: Ticket volumes
- Engineering: Error logs  
- Design: Heatmaps

Everyone had data. No one had clarity.

**Impact of fragmentation:**
- **2.3 weeks** to identify and diagnose issues
- **45%** team confidence in prioritization decisions
- **Constant misalignment** on what to fix first

---

## The Solution: Visual Journey Intelligence

Instead of adding another analytics tool, we built a **journey-first platform** that:

1. **Maps the complete user experience** across all touchpoints
2. **Surfaces friction automatically** through integrated analytics and feedback
3. **Enables rapid experimentation** with built-in A/B testing workflows

### Why This Approach Works

Traditional analytics answer "what happened?" This tool answers "why did it happen?" and "what should we do about it?"

By consolidating journey data into a single visual canvas:
- ✅ Identify patterns invisible in traditional dashboards
- ✅ Align stakeholders around the same user experience
- ✅ Test hypotheses in days, not weeks

## Key Capabilities

### 1. End-to-End Journey Visualization
Map every step from awareness to conversion with automatic friction detection at each stage.

### 2. Multi-Source Data Integration
- Analytics platforms (Mixpanel, Google Analytics)
- User feedback tools (Hotjar, Zendesk, Intercom)
- Custom event tracking
- Real-time monitoring and alerts

### 3. Friction Heatmapping
Automatic identification of:
- High drop-off points
- Extended time-on-task outliers
- Negative sentiment clustering
- Technical error patterns

### 4. Hypothesis-Driven Testing
Built-in A/B testing framework with:
- Variant creation from journey insights
- Real-time result tracking
- Statistical significance indicators
- Presentation-ready export

## The KYC Optimization Results

### Discovery Phase (5 days)
Using the journey mapper, we identified three friction sources:

1. **Unclear instructions** (user feedback analysis)
2. **Mobile upload failures** (error log integration)
3. **Excessive required fields** (drop-off correlation)

### Testing Phase (7 days)
- Created 3 variants addressing each friction point
- Ran simultaneous A/B tests
- Variant combining all fixes showed 53% improvement

### Final Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| KYC Drop-off Rate | 47% | 22% | **53% reduction** |
| Problem ID Time | 2.3 weeks | 5 days | **8x faster** |
| Team Alignment | 45% | 89% | **98% improvement** |
| Revenue Recovery | $0 | $1.2M | **Annual gain** |
| User Satisfaction | 6.2/10 | 8.7/10 | **40% improvement** |
