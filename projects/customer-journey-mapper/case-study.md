## Solution Implementation

### Approach
Map the complete journey visually. Surface friction automatically. Test solutions rapidly.

### Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Week 1 | 2 days | Journey mapping and data integration |
| Week 2 | 3 days | Friction point analysis |
| Week 3 | 5 days | Hypothesis formation and variant design |
| Week 4 | 7 days | A/B test execution |
| Week 5-6 | 10 days | Results analysis and rollout |

### Implementation Steps

    participant PM as Product Manager
    participant CJM as Journey Mapper
    participant Data as Analytics Data
    participant Team as Cross-functional Team
    
    PM-&gt;&gt;CJM: Map KYC flow
    CJM-&gt;&gt;Data: Import analytics
    Data-&gt;&gt;CJM: Return drop-off data
    CJM-&gt;&gt;PM: Highlight 47% drop at verification
    PM-&gt;&gt;CJM: Pull user feedback
    CJM-&gt;&gt;PM: Show "unclear requirements" theme
    PM-&gt;&gt;Team: Share visual journey map
    Team-&gt;&gt;PM: Align on solution
    PM-&gt;&gt;CJM: Create test variants
    CJM-&gt;&gt;Data: Run A/B test
    Data-&gt;&gt;CJM: Variant B wins (22% drop-off)
    CJM-&gt;&gt;PM: Export results
    PM-&gt;&gt;Team: Deploy winning variant
```
