# GenAI Product Case Study

**Designing and validating financial GenAI features**

## Problem
Unclear product fit and risks for applying GenAI in regulated finance environments.

## Solution
Lean experiments, safety and privacy checks, and measurable pilots.

**Approach:**
- Hypothesis-driven experiments
- Small pilots with closed-domain models
- Human-in-the-loop validation and monitoring
- Risk assessment framework

## Impact
- Validated prototypes with clear success criteria
- Defined guardrails for production use
- Production readiness checklist

## Key Learnings
- Start with narrow, well-defined use cases
- Model risk management is critical in finance
- Human oversight remains essential
- Transparency builds user trust
