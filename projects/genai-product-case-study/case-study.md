# GenAI Product Case Study — Detailed

## Problem
Need to evaluate where GenAI adds measurable value while controlling model risk.

## Approach
- Hypothesis-driven experiments
- Small pilots with closed-domain models
- Human-in-the-loop validation and monitoring

## Impact
- Clarified priorities and production readiness checklist

## Notes
- Keep datasets and evaluation artifacts in a secure storage location; reference them here.

## Capability Validation Approach

**This demonstrates product management through working code + realistic scenarios:**

| Element | Validation Method |
|---------|------------------|
| Technical Skills | Deployed prototypes with measurable performance |
| Product Frameworks | Applied to documented industry patterns |
| Impact Modeling | Calculated using standard fintech economics |
| Documentation | Professional artifacts showing clear thinking |

**Evaluate this work for:** Problem diagnosis clarity · Solution design rigor · Metrics-based thinking · Execution capability

**Not production claims.** These are skill demonstrations using realistic parameters informed by capital markets experience.
