## Methodology Note
These figures demonstrate:
- **Technical Benchmarks:** Validated through working prototypes (throughput, latency, uptime targets)
- **Business Models:** Calculated outcomes using standard fintech conversion economics
- **Framework Results:** Improvement pathways based on common optimization patterns

Use these to evaluate analytical rigor and product thinking, not as production claims.
