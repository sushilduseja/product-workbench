# How to navigate this repository

- README.md — overview of portfolio and links
- projects/ — add each project as its own git repo or subfolder
- visuals/ — store visual assets (prefer external hosting for large files)
- impact/ — add metrics & testimonials used in case studies

Best practice

- Keep large media out of git (use S3/Cloud storage or LFS)
- Keep a single `case-study.md` per project that lists problem, solution, metrics, and lessons learned
